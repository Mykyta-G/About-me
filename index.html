            <p class="text">I'm a 17-year-old born on December 20, 2006. Growing up, I've picked up three languages
                along the way: Ukrainian, Swedish, and English, which have become a big part of who I am today. I've
                always been fascinated by how language can shape our thoughts and connect us with different cultures,
                but that's just one of many things that drive me.</p>
            <p class="text">Right now, I'm in my third year at NTI, where I've been diving deep into subjects that
                interest me. School has been a place where I've grown not just academically but also as a person,
                learning to balance the demands of studies with my other interests. NTI has definitely pushed me to
                think critically and manage my time effectively.</p>
            <p class="text">As I approach the end of my time at NTI, I'm reflecting on how much I've changed and what I
                want to do next. The skills and knowledge I've gained here, along with the experiences that have shaped
                me, are preparing me for whatever comes after graduation. I'm looking forward to taking on new
                challenges and seeing where life takes me next.

            <p class="text2">This is my latest project, where I dove into learning how to use GSAP (GreenSock Animation
                Platform) for creating animations. GSAP has opened up a whole new world of possibilities for me in web
                development and design. I've been experimenting with different effects, making elements move smoothly,
                and creating interactive experiences that are both engaging and visually appealing.
                <br><br>
                The process of learning GSAP has been challenging but incredibly rewarding. I've gone from
                knowing very little about animation to being able to control timelines, manage complex sequences, and
                create animations that really stand out. It's amazing how much of a difference it makes when you can
                bring a website to life with animations that respond to user interactions in such a fluid and dynamic
                way.</p>
